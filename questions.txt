1. Are buffs like Nashor's unique? Do they stack? Does it refresh the duration? 
    - how to test: get a unit with low mana, blue buff, nashors 
    - current assumption: they refresh duration


2. With an AOE spell like Varus & i.e. - does it either crit for all targets/no targets or can it crit for some but not others? 
    - current assumption: the spell can crit, if it crits it crits for everyone, if it doesn't it crits for no one
    - except thats a little harder to code 
    - so just let it crit independently for everyone :/

    - fixing this would probably mean: put the RNG generation in with the spell cast so that it can apply for everyone

    - okay this is fixed slay! it crits for everyone or no one! I hope that's right, please check it 

3. Need to hard code the 5 attack speed cap

4. Need to count how many different targets are hit by a spell for things like burn/wound application. Although... I mean... idk if that needs to be spelled out


alternating casts? how to handle? 
counting number of casts + attacks 

renaming "scaling" to "ratio" in spell column names :/






idea: add a function for "reduce by x%". Inspired by Powder's spell
